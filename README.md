# EPS-research-workflows-jupyter

This repository contains files for the research workflow workshop (Jupyter session), organized for the incoming graduate student cohort of the Earth and Planetary Science Department at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Set Up

1. Download and install the anaconda Python 3.7 distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
2. Download this repository: https://github.com/yuempark/EPS-research-workflows-jupyter
    * Click the green `Clone or download` button near the upper right of the screen, then select `Download ZIP`
3. Quickly check that your distribution is working by running the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
    * `jupyter notebook`
    * If your browser opens up with the jupyter app, success! Otherwise, send me an email and we can try to resolve the issue.
    * You can quit the jupyter app by typing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal/command prompt, or just closing the associated terminal/command prompt.
